## 🎯 Tweet Generation Principles

### 1. **Lead with Insight, Not News**
- ✅ "Here's why this matters more than you think..."
- ❌ "Company announces new product..."

### 2. **Complete Thoughts Only**
- ✅ Each sentence should stand alone as complete idea
- ❌ Never trail off with "..."

### 3. **Spark Conversation**
- ✅ Ask questions, challenge assumptions, make bold claims
- ❌ Just announce or summarize

### 4. **Natural Language**
- ✅ Write like texting a smart friend
- ❌ Corporate buzzwords and marketing speak

### 5. **Strategic Hashtags**
- ✅ 0-1 highly relevant tags
- ❌ 3+ generic tags

### 6. **Optimal Length**
- ✅ 200-240 characters (with link)
- ❌ Cramming to 280 or cutting off at 140
